Steps to POST via telnet:

1. run server.rb in terminal
2. open new terminal tab, connect via telnet:
    telnet localhost 4567
3. POST /ingredients HTTP/1.1
   Host: localhost
   Content-Length: [number of characters including "ingredient=" and whitespace]
4. <enter>
5. ingredient=3+tablespoons+good+olive+oil
        (use '+' in place of ' ')
6. <enter>

This will send the POST request to the server, which will add your new
ingredient to the hash params, so:

params["ingredient"] = "3 tablespoons good olive oil"

The method then opens and appends params["ingredient"] to ingredients.txt, so
when localhost:4567/ is refreshed, the GET method now pulls the new lines from
ingredients.txt and adds them to the list of ingredients on localhost:4567/.
