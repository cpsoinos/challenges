You have been commissioned by the premier League of Cool Kickball Professionals (LACKP) to build their first website. Lucky you!

### Learning Objectives

* Build a Sinatra application to serve dynamically generated HTML.
* Extract information from a JSON data source.

### Instructions

The league currently has 4 teams. We have supplied a JSON file containing the roster.

The application should satisfy the following user story:

```no-highlight
As a Kickball Fan
I want to view the professional teams
So that I can learn more about the players
```

Acceptance Criteria:

* I can navigate to a distinct url and web page for each team
* Each team page displays the team's name
* Each team page displays each player's name along with their position

For an extra **optional** challenge, implement a feature to satisfy the following user story:

```no-highlight
As a Kickball Fan
I want to see all players in a certain position
So that I can see who plays each position in the league
```

Acceptance Criteria:

* I can navigate to a distinct url for each position
* Each position page displays the position
* Each position page lists each player in that position along with their team name
