Let's take a look at the following compound data structure:

```ruby
people =
{
  "Alia O'Conner PhD" => {
         "phone" => "538.741.1841",
       "company" => "Leuschke-Stiedemann",
      "children" => [
          "Simone",
          "Cindy",
          "Jess"
      ]
  },
           "Ike Haag" => {
         "phone" => "(661) 663-8352",
       "company" => "Carter Inc",
      "children" => [
          "Joe",
          "Ofelia",
          "Deron"
      ]
  },
       "Brian Heller" => {
         "phone" => "1-288-601-5886",
       "company" => "O'Conner Group",
      "children" => [
          "Renee"
      ]
  },
       "Maryse Johns" => {
         "phone" => "218-571-8774",
       "company" => "Kuhlman Group",
      "children" => [
          "Domenick",
          "Trycia"
      ]
  },
  "Dr. Adela DuBuque" => {
        "phone" => "1-203-483-1226",
      "company" => "Heidenreich, Nitzsche and Dickinson"
  }
}
```

Write Ruby code to find out the answers to the following questions:

* How many people are in `people` (excluding children)?
* What are the names of all the people?
* What is the phone number of Alia O'Conner PhD?
* How many children does Brian Heller have?
* What company does Dr. Adela DuBuque work for?
* What are the names of the people who have children?
* What are the names of the people who do not have children?
* What is Brian Heller's child's name?
* What is Maryse Johns' first child's name?
* Dr. Adela DuBuque just had a baby named Tomas. How would you update the hash for this information?

Let's try another compound data structure:

```ruby
sets_of_people =
[
  {
         "Bernard Feil" => {
             "phone" => "(880) 434-0630",
           "company" => "Maggio Inc",
          "children" => [
              "Nikki"
          ]
      },
          "Ruby Hessel" => {
             "phone" => "1-467-852-4981",
           "company" => "Kemmer Inc",
          "children" => [
              "Sydney"
          ]
      },
          "Savanah Toy" => {
             "phone" => "440-632-0287",
           "company" => "Hudson, Stehr and Lind",
          "children" => [
              "Garth"
          ]
      },
      "Casandra Kemmer" => {
            "phone" => "1-515-759-7470",
          "company" => "Davis, Bernier and Hermann"
      },
             "Edd Rath" => {
            "phone" => "(522) 829-3164",
          "company" => "Mosciski LLC"
      }
  },
  {
         "Dagmar Brakus" => {
             "phone" => "1-881-313-1173",
           "company" => "Mitchell, Schmitt and Haley",
          "children" => [
              "Reuben"
          ]
      },
         "Einar Effertz" => {
            "phone" => "(265) 857-5141",
          "company" => "Pfeffer, Klocko and Von"
      },
      "Dr. Sigrid Nader" => {
             "phone" => "707.762.7870",
           "company" => "Weissnat, Hayes and Dickinson",
          "children" => [
              "Israel",
              "Elyse",
              "Wilfredo"
          ]
      }
  }
]
```

Write Ruby code to find out the answers to the following questions:

* How many people are in the first set of people?
* How many people are in the second set of people?
* What is Ruby Hessel's phone number?
* What are the names of Dr. Sigrid Nader's children?
* What is Bernard Feil's child's name?
* What company does Casandra Kemmer work for?
* Who are all the people in the first set that have an `m` in their Company names?
